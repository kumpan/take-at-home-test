# Kumpan Take at home assignment

Thank you for taking time to do our take at home assignment. 

## Task

Create a small SPA application that uses Google Maps API, which lets the user save interesting places the user wants to visit in Stockholm. Use one of the following frameworks Vue/React/Angular. You decide on the design.

## Requirements
- Pre-Populate the map with the data from the `data.json` found in this repo
- Show map of Stockholm with zoom level of 11
- Clicking on map shows a popup appears with the input Name and a button Save
- List that shows saved places: 
  - Click on place zooms the map to that locations and shows popup with name 
  - List should be filterable using a input Search 
  - Delete button removes that saved place


## Bonus points
- Use some sort of state management 
- Write tests

## Submission Guidelines

* Create a private repository on github and ask the recruiter for whom to invite to this repository. **Do not publish this repository.**

* The reposityr should contain a README.md file with instructions on how to run the project and your thoughts on how you solved it.
* It is allowed to use app generators like `create-react-app`. But before submitting the solution all of the configuration needs **to be ejected** (npm run eject or yarn eject).
